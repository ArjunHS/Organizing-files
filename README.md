# Organizing-files
Organizing files by grouping all similar files with same format together reduces a lot of clutter from our folders and helps organize files better and keep our folders neat and tidy. 
Using Python we can achieve this in a easy and simple way.

Try running the code by changing just the folder location. The code is very robust and can be used to clear a lot of clutter and organize folders quickly.
